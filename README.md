This is a sample repository that describes a step-by-step error concept and patterns used in Go technology.  
Code fragments were presented during an online meeting held on <b>09.02.2024</b>. 
The sample code has been prepared so that it can be run as a separate unit in the main package. 
A collective list of references is available in the presentation directory in the References section. 
Feel free to use the examples as you wish.
